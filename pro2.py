class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):# 1. __init__ is the constructor method. It's automatically called when you create a new object (an instance) of the class. 'mysillyobject' is a parameter that, by convention, is named 'self'. It refers to the instance of the object being created. While you can name it something else like 'mysillyobject', it's strongly recommended to stick with 'self' for readability and to follow Python conventions. 'name' and 'age' are parameters that you pass when creating a Person object.
    mysillyobject.name = name            # 2. This line assigns the value passed as the 'name' argument during object creation to an attribute also named 'name' of the current object ('mysillyobject'). Each Person object will have its own 'name' attribute.
    mysillyobject.age = age              # 3. Similarly, this line assigns the value passed as the 'age' argument to an attribute named 'age' of the current object ('mysillyobject'). Each Person object will have its own 'age' attribute.

  def myfunc(abc):                        # 4. This defines a method named 'myfunc' that belongs to the Person class. 'abc' is the first parameter, which, by convention, should be 'self'. It refers to the specific instance of the Person object that this method is being called on. Again, while you can name it 'abc', using 'self' is the standard practice.
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name) # 5. Inside the 'myfunc' method, this line prints the string "Hello my name is " concatenated with the 'name' attribute of the specific Person object ('abc') that called this method.

p1 = Person("Sultan", 36)                 # 6. This line creates a new object (an instance) of the Person class. When this line is executed, the __init__ method is automatically called with 'mysillyobject' referring to the newly created object, 'name' set to "Sultan", and 'age' set to 36. The newly created object is then assigned to the variable 'p1'.
p1.myfunc()                               # 7. This line calls the 'myfunc' method on the 'p1' object. When this happens, the 'abc' parameter in 'myfunc' automatically refers to the 'p1' object. Therefore, it will print "Hello my name is Sultan" to the console.
